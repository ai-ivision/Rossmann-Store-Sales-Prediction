# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately forecast daily sales for Rossmann stores across different locations and time periods.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide Rossmann with a reliable sales forecasting tool that can assist in strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and inventory management. By accurately predicting daily sales, Rossmann can optimize staffing, stock levels, and promotional activities to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical sales data from various Rossmann stores, along with information such as store attributes, promotional activities, and external factors like holidays and competitor actions. The dataset provides a rich source of information to train and evaluate machine learning models for sales prediction.

### Approach
- Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data, identify outliers, and explore relationships between variables.
Data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Feature Engineering
Feature engineering to create relevant features for model training, such as date-related features, promotional indicators, and store attributes.
- Model Development
Selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms for time-series forecasting, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning regression models.
Training the models using historical sales data and relevant features.
- Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning and model selection based on performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
- Evaluation
Cross-validation to assess model performance on unseen data and mitigate overfitting.
Evaluation of the model's accuracy and robustness using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Visualization of forecasted sales compared to actual sales to understand model performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Results
The developed machine learning model achieves accurate daily sales forecasts for Rossmann stores across different locations and time periods. The model's performance is validated through rigorous evaluation and testing on unseen data, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in predicting sales.

- Future Work
Integration of external data sources such as weather data, economic indicators, and demographic information to enhance the accuracy of sales forecasts.
Implementation of advanced forecasting techniques such as ensemble methods, deep learning models, or hybrid approaches to further improve predictive performance.
Deployment of the trained model into production systems for real-time sales forecasting and decision support at Rossmann stores.
